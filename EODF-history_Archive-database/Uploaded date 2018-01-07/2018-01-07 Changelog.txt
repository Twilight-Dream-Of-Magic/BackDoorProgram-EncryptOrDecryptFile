1.Repair binary file header is wrongly calculated problem
2.The module for encrypting file algorithms and decrypting file algorithms has been updated and file security is enhanced. (From the author's operation, the core code is modified)
3.Fix display text error
4.Compatibility decreases (Due to the algorithm update, [low version of the program, you can not open the file generated by the high version], [high version of the program, you can not open the low version of the generated file]. For example, you can not use (Test Beta 3.1) or later and older versions to encrypt and decrypt (Test Beta 3.1) created files and calculated files so that you will not get any useful data. Unreasonable use of program version, it is impossible.)
